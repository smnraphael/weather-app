#### Description:
This is a Weather App built with React and OpenWeather's API.
I also added a dark mode for visual comfort.

#### User experience:
The user can input the name of a city in the text field. Then he can click on the search button. He will be able to see the weather for the city he chosen.
The user will be able to see:
- City name
- Temperature
- Feels like
- Min
- Max
- Wind
- Visibility
- Pressure
- Humidity

#### Technologies:
For this Weather App, I first created a Figma for the design. Then, I used HTML/CSS and React. And also the API from OpenWeather.
